				<p>Ryan or Ry, whatever it is that you prefer.</p>

			<h4 align="left">Favorite CMSC subject so far and why:</h4>
				<p>I really enjoyed CMSC22, the learning environment was really fun even though the subject isn't really that easy.</p>
			<br/>
			<h4 align="left">Favorite GE so far and why:</h4>
				<p>I liked KAS 1, a GE I took a year ago. Even though the subject seem boring, our professor somehow managed to make it really enjoyable because he's got a ton of jokes and he also offers a lot of demonstrations no one would've had expected.</p>
			<br/>
			<h4 align="left">Favorite PL and why:</h4>
				<p>So far I really loved Java, it just felt like there's so much you can do with it, or maybe because we just had a lot of tasks that have to do with it. Either way it was fun.</p>
			<br/>
			<h4 align="left">Favorite food:</h4>
				<p>Pizza or carbonara.</p>
